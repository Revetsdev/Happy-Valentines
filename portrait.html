		94,608,000 seconds 1,576,800 minutes, 26,280 hours, 1,095 days, 156 weeks, 36 months Happy Valentine's Day and Happy 3rd Anniversary! Today is not just about love; it's about our love, a journey that has grown stronger, deeper, and more beautiful with each passing day. Three years ago, we started this incredible adventure together, and I wouldn’t trade a single moment of it for anything in the world. From the laughter we’ve shared to the challenges we’ve conquered, every experience with you has been a blessing. You are not just my partner but my best friend, my greatest supporter, and the love of my life. Your kindness, strength, and unwavering love inspire me every day, and I am so grateful to have you by my side. Looking back, I see how much we have grown—not just as individuals but as a couple. Every hug, every late-night talk, and every little gesture of love has built the strong foundation we stand on today. And now, as we step into another year together, I know our love will only continue to flourish. I promise to always cherish and support you, to stand by you in all moments, and to love you with all my heart—today, tomorrow, and for all the years to come. No matter what life brings, I know that as long as we have each other, we can handle anything. So today, on our special day, I just want to say: Thank you. Thank you for choosing me, for loving me, and for making my world brighter every single day. I love you more than words can ever express, and I look forward to spending many more anniversaries and Valentine’s Days with you.--
